1.	Changed the Anki deck (japReader.apkg) to match the main app theme.


1.3.2
1.  Added light mode.
2.  Restyled a little bit.
3.  Removed version names from files and intructions, 
    because it's annoying to update everything every update.


1.3.1
1.  Restyled everything, because the contrast was too random 
    and some things were hard to read.


1.3.0
1.  Added the ability to change the status of a word with mouse buttons:
    -   Seen: Right Mouse Button
    -   Known: Middle Mouse Button
    -   Ignore: Ctrl + Left Mouse Button

    -   Play audio: A
    -   Add to Anki: Q
